		<h1>Opera Mini</h1>
		<p>Opera Mini is a proxy browser that focuses on both decreasing bandwidth use as well as enabling lower-powered devices to better experience the web. Pages are requested by their servers, rendered on the server, and then passed to the client in a proprietary format.</p>
		<p>Can also be enabled using "Off-Road" mode in Opera mobile.</p>

		<h2>Basic Architecture</h2>
		<p>When the client makes a request, the request is routed through Opera's servers. Depending on which client you are using, this may be done over traditional HTTP or via a socket that is kept open during the session (providing a boost in performance). The servers perform the initial DNS resolution. They also initiate each request over their own networks (sending an X-Forwarded-For header). The pages are rendered on the server, and all JS execution takes place on the server.</p>
		<p>The page is sent back to the client in a proprietary format using OBML. Whenever something happens that may change the DOM or Render Tree, the client makes a request to the server. The server sends back the updated snapshot of the page for the client to display</p>
		<h2>Gotchas</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>CSS and SVG animations will not showâ€”only the first frame is rendered.</li>
			<li>Web fonts are not downloaded.</li>
			<li>Only supports certain events. JS-only API's will not work.</li>
			<li>CSS features such as border-radius and gradients are disabled to reduce pagesize.</li>
		</ul>
