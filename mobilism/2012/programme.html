       <p>OK, so in mobile there are about 25 browsers, 20 operators, 15 device vendors (excluding the tiny ones), and 10 operating systems. Do you know your way around all of them?</p>
       <p>Especially for people who come from the quiet, reclusive zone that is the desktop web, with only 5 browsers and 3 platforms, the mobile world can be a daunting place where everything happens at once, relations are much more complicated than you expect, and the sheer amount of actors is confusing.</p>
       <p>In this session PPK will attempt to bring some order in the chaos by discussing about seven of the most important actors, their relations, and their long-term plans. After this talk you can amaze your friends by explaining why Windows Phone will never amount to much, why Android fragmentation will become only worse, in which way Apple has stolen a march on its competitors, and what Nokia is doing.</p>

       <p>The web deserves to be the third mobile runtime, but it isn't. What is holding it back? It faces challenges from industry, the standards process, browser implementations, and probably our own short-sightedness.</p>
       <p>The web's unnerving ability to disrupt shouldn't be taken for granted. It wants to evolve, but we must encourage that process in order for it to become competitive again.</p>
       <p>On a journey from device APIs to standards groups, from test suites to provocative demos, let's figure out how to move the web forward towards a brave mobile future.</p>

       <h2>Laurent Hasson — Tricks and hacks for a more native feel in a mobile browser</h2>
       <p>Most mobile Web developers come from a traditional desktop development background. As such, many are not aware of key differences between desktop browsers and mobile browsers once they are trying to build an app vs a traditional web site, even if adapted for mobile. In this introductory session aimed at desktop developers interested in making the jump to mobile, we will present the technical tricks that are needed to circumvent a mobile browser's own interface (touch and gesture management, viewport and other aspects) to deliver a web app that looks and feels like a native app. We will discuss among other things how to virtualize the browser's own event loop, block swipe and pinch/zoom gestures, pin down the viewport, and a simple trick to build a mobile touch-based app that also works on a desktop browser with mouse events.</p>

       <h2>Greg Schechter &amp; Eugene Goldin — Mobile Meow: Bringing YouTube Videos to a Mobile World</h2>
       <p>This is the story of the glory and struggle of bringing a high quality YouTube experience to the mobile web. Once upon a time there was a web developer who wanted to play videos on the web. So he filmed a cat and wrote a Flash and a HTML5 player. He spent many hours making it work on his favorite desktop browsers and even the one his grandfather still used. People could watch his cat video, he smiled, and the world was good. Then one day someone put a browser in a phone and soon there were many phones with many different browsers. This new set of environments were even harder to develop for and had a slew of new terrifying bugs. The web developer was miserable knowing people couldn’t watch his cat video. With much time and effort he figured out many of the secrets needed to combat the evils of the different mobile platforms. Once again people could watch his cat vid eo, he smiled, and the world was good. The end.</p>

       <h2>Kevin Whinnery — Ending the Web Versus Native Debate</h2>
       <p>The &quot;web versus native&quot; debate is raging among mobile developers. Build native? You're locking yourself into a (usually closed and proprietary) platform and duplicating effort. Build for the web? You're sacrificing performance and features that benefit users. Like most divisive debates, there's a lot of truth on both sides.</p>
       <p>Titanium Mobile is set on squashing this debate by providing developers an open source, extensible platform for building real native apps and rich web apps with a unified JavaScript API.</p>
       <p>In this presentation, we will dissect the &quot;web versus native&quot; problem, and see how Titanium is solving cross-platform in a way that sidesteps the underlying issues in this debate. We'll also check out a real, multi-platform Titanium codebase, and learn how to target multiple platforms without falling into the common trap of &quot;write once, suck everywhere&quot;. Prior JavaScript knowledge is very helpful to understand the code walkthroughs, but not strictly necessary.</p>

Since joining Appcelerator in 2008, Kevin has been involved in the launch and large scale adoption of the Titanium platform by speaking at developer-focused events, providing hands-on training, and developing some of the most complex native apps ever built on the platform.</p>
        <p>In addition to his experience with Titanium Mobile, Kevin has developed rich client apps using Adobe Flex, open web technologies in the browser (HTML 5/CSS 3/JavaScript), Silverlight, and WPF, giving him a unique perspective on rich client application development. Kevin lives in Saint Paul, Minnesota with his beautiful wife and three devious children.</p>

       <p>Device diversity is about to get an order of magnitude worse. SmartTVs are hitting the market in mass this year. Sony, LG, Vizio, and Samsung are all shipping televisions with Google TV built in.</p>
       <p>And if the rumors that Apple will release a TV this year are true, 2012 will turn out to be the year web developers start to tackle the glass screen hanging on our walls.</p>
       <p>Why should web developers focused on mobile learn about the web on TVs? Because TVs represent the next challenge in device proliferation. They share common characteristics with their smaller brethren. They create new challenges and opportunities we haven't encountered yet. And most importantly, learning how to build for TVs helps inform our practices of building for mobile devices.</p>

       <p>Modern web technologies and responsive design aim at platform independent code while promising first-class experience on any mobile device. Even though purely web-based approaches can achieve stunning results, they (still) cannot compete with their native counterpart regarding platform features and integration.</p>
       <p>In this talk, I will show you how we can use JavaScript to produce mobile apps that include features such as native UI, push notifications, sensors, and paid distribution. You can expect lots of live demos when I will compare the strengths and weaknesses of various frameworks.</p>

       <h1>Beyond mobile, beyond web <span><a href="programme.html#scott-slot" title="Back to the schedule">↑</a></span></h1>
       <p>Today's mobile phone is a combination of two aging paradigms: native applications and web browsing. Each is fine on their own but the mixture is actually taking the worst of both. The mobile web has the potential to be a transformative technology, doing so much more than just downloading a web page on a small screen. Native applications, for their part, are a siloed holdover from main frames, forcing the user to manage the discovery, installation, and removal of all functionality.</p>
       <p>This is tolerable today because there is relatively little need to manage functionality on your phone. Installing a few apps really isn't that burdensome. However, the plummeting cost of processing and connectivity will change that creating an explosion of smart posters, devices, televisions, and more, all of which will likely require their own 'app'. It just isn't possible to install an app for every store I visit, every product I own, and and every smart thingy I pass in the street. This talk will explore a new approach, combining the best of native and mobile web to create a 'just-in-time' model of functionality.</p>

       <h1>Responsive Design Workflow <span><a href="programme.html#stephen-slot" title="Back to the schedule">↑</a></span></h1>
       <p>In our industry, everything changes quickly, usually for the better. We have more and better tools for creating websites and applications that work across multiple platforms. Oddly enough, design workflow hasn't changed much, and what <strong>has</strong> changed is often for worse. Through the years, increasing focus on bloated client deliverables has hurt both content and design, often reducing these disciplines to fill-in-the-blank and color-by-numbers exercises, respectively. Old-school workflow is simply not effective on our multiplatform Web.</p>
       <p>In this session, Stephen explores at a content-based approach to design workflow which is grounded in our multiplatform reality, not fixed-width Photoshop comps and overproduced wireframes. You'll learn how to avoid being surprised by the realities of multiplatform websites. You'll learn how to better manage client expectations and development requirements. You've probably heard of designing in the browser; in this session you'll learn a practical approach for actually doing it.</p>

       <p>The Application Cache is one of the cool bits of HTML5, allowing sites to work without a network connection brings us much closer to native app-like behaviour. However, from HTML5 roundup articles and talks you may be left with the impression that it's a magic-bullet fix, unfortunately it isn't, the Application Cache is a douchebag.</p>
       <p>I don't mean 'incompetent' or 'difficult', definitely 'douchebag'. The Application Cache has skills we need, but if you asked him to paint your bathroom he'd somehow manage to flood your kitchen and break your TV in the process, and he wouldn't care.</p>

       <p>You've likely heard about content a lot lately—content is king, content should flow like water, &quot;Content First!&quot;. But what IS content in its basest form? Is it HTML? XML? JSON? Is it human-readable plaintext? And once we have our content, how do we transform it to look wonderful on mobile devices, televisions, regular old computers, refrigerators? Where does content end and platform-specific representation begin? The mobile revolution has shown us that our content management and web publishing technologies are entangled and flawed. The web will continue to be consumed by more and more clients, many of which haven't even occurred to us yet. But by thinking deeply and re-examining the essence of our content, we can help to architect a flexible future for the web.</p>
