   <title>Mobilism 2015 announced</title>
   <link>http://mobilism.nl/blog/2014/10/mobilism-2015-announced</link>
   <description>On Friday 27th of March 2015 Mobilism will return after a break of a year. Where the first three editions were mostly occupied with web development for mobile phones, this edition is going to cast its net a little wider. We know how to make sites for iOS and Android now, but what's going to be next? Are you ready for TV? Connected devices? Proxy browsers? Come and see!</description>

   <title>Mobilism speaker change and workshops</title>
   <link>http://mobilism.nl/blog/2013/05/mobilism-speaker-change-and-workshops</link>
   <description>In two weeks' time the third edition of Mobilism will take place in Amsterdam. Tickets are still available; in fact, as Peter-Paul Koch recently wrote, ticket sales have not been overwhelming this year and we've had to economise. That's why we will sit down and think hard about Mobilism's future once the conference is done and dusted.</description>
